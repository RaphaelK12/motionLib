hi,i am new to github. 2012-7-19

it's very cool to share my code with others i think. **feel free to join me :)** 2012-7-24

The  algorithm repository will not update any more,so i deleted it, and start a new repo. 2013-5-12 

**brief**: motionLib is a small lib in computer animation/graphic project, i used it in  data compression and motion synthesis. 

**note**: these files may depend on each other,in most cases, you need to include them all in your project. And the CASEParser class is absent for license issue.
